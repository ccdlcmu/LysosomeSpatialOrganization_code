# Deciphering Organelle Positioning and Dynamics
This repo contains all scripts/code used for the paper titled " Whole-cell scale dynamic organization of lysosomes revealed by spatial statistical analysis " submitted to " Cell Reports "

## Folders
### 1. Quantify Organelle Spatial distribution 
```
The scripts for the following analysis are present:
 1. Ripley's K/L test (for checking spatial randomness)
 2. Quantifying spatial metrics (among multiple cells and within a single cell over time)
	i. Inter-Organelle distribution
	ii. Nearest-Neighbor distribution
	iii. Normalized to Nucleus distance
```
### 2. Variability Measures
```
The following distance measures between probability distributions are calculated:
 1. Bhattacharyya distance
 2. Euclidean distance
 3. Area Overlap distance
```
### 3. Quantify Organelle dynamics
```
Organelle dynamics are quantified via:
 1. MSD (Mean-square displacement)
 2. Segregating MSD into 3 modes of motion
	i. Active Transport
	ii. Brownian Diffusion
	iii. Confined Diffusion
```
### 4. Micellaneous
